## Features

### Quick configuration

When holding a configured blueprint, an upgrade planner, or a deconstruction planner, use `Shift + B` or press the GUI button to open the configuration window for that item. This is especially useful for upgrade and deconstruction planners, allowing you to quickly grab a planner, configure it how you need, use it a few times, then destroy it with ease.

### Swap wire colors

Press `Shift + C` or press the button to swap a blueprint's circuit wire colors.

### Set tiles

Press `Shift + T` or press the button to open the `Set tiles` GUI. This function will place tiles under the entities in your blueprint, with an option to fill gaps and add margins around each entity or the entire blueprint.

### Quick-grid

Press `Shift + G` or press the button to quickly set a relative grid on the currently held blueprint. The grid will be set to the size of the blueprint. For custom grids, use the `Quick configuration` hotkey and do it through the GUI.

### Adjust grid position

Press `Shift + Up/Down/Left/Right` to adjust the grid position relative to blueprint entitites. Ideal for aligning tileable defenses and rails.

### Adjust absolute grid position

Press `Control + Shift + Up/Down/Left/Right` (for individual blueprints) or `Shift + Alt + Up/Down/Left/Right` (for all blueprints with absolute grid position in a book) to adjust the absolute grid position offsets. Blueprint size is taken into account when setting the offsets to avoid having excessivly high offset values. Excellent option when working on city block-style bases.

When adjusting all blueprints in a book, currently selected blueprint must have absolute grid position enabled.

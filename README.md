## Features

### Quick configuration

When holding a configured blueprint, an upgrade planner, or a deconstruction planner, use `Shift + B` or press the GUI button to open the configuration window for that item. This is especially useful for upgrade and deconstruction planners, allowing you to quickly grab a planner, configure it how you need, use it a few times, then destroy it with ease.

### Swap wire colors

Press `Shift + C` or press the button to swap a blueprint's circuit wire colors.

### Set tiles

Press `Shift + T` or press the button to open the `Set tiles` GUI. This function will place tiles under the entities in your blueprint, with an option to fill gaps and add margins around each entity or the entire blueprint.

### Quick-grid

Press `Shift + G` or press the button to quickly set a relative grid on the currently held blueprint. The grid will be set to the size of the blueprint. For custom grids, use the `Quick configuration` hotkey and do it through the GUI.

# Brainstorming

## Problems I want to solve
- Quickly setting grids on blueprints
  - Mostly for copy/paste, having a quick way to get relative grids would be nice
- Flip & turn, landfill, circuit wires swapping, and placement snapping from Blueprint Extensions
- Customize cut/copy/paste settings
  - Perhaps switch between different configs on the fly?
- Quick planner configuration
  - Upgrade planner: quick filter setting
  - Deconstruction planner: toggle whitelist/blacklist, tiles mode, quick filter setting
  - Quick tessellation of the blueprint in hand
